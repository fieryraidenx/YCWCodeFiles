'''Warmup #4: Only do this if you've watched ALL the looping skill videos. Your goal is to create a small minigame using this board(the board must be a 5x5 grid, but you can change the values)'''

board = [
	[0,0,0,0,0],
	[0,0,0,0,0],
	[0,0,0,0,0],
	[0,0,0,0,0],
	[0,0,0,0,0]
]

'''Here are some examples:
1.)The user chooses a spot. If the spot is an X, they win. If it isn't, they can try again

2.)The user can enter a different functions that change the board. For example, if they enter "X", you create an X on the board, and if they enter "O", you create an O on the board

3.)CHALLENGE: Create a Battleship type game where there are two boards. Each player takes a turn trying to sink the other battleship(just 1 for times sake). If they do, they win!
