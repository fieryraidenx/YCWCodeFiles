'''Warmup 2 will quiz you on conditionals and user input'''

#Ask the user for two numbers. If the first number is greater than the second, print 'Good Job!'. If it is less than the second, print 'Not so Great.'. If they are equal to eachother, print 'Oh Well...'.


#CHALLENGE: The above code will return an error if the user enters something that is not a number(ex. "trolololol"). Find a way to avoid that error.
