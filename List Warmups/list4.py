'''Warmup 5: Grocery List'''

"""
Objective
---------
Your parents have asked you to make a long grocery list.
Writing long lists is boring, so you decided to automate this process with python.

Your goal is to note down the name of each item and the quantity needed.

Hint: Use what you know about lists and dictionaries to achieve this goal.
Good luck.
